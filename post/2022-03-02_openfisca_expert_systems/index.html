<p>This is a draft of a paper being prepared for the Singapore Management University Centre for Computational Law&rsquo;s <a href>Computational Legal Studies Conference 2022</a>.
As an accepted paper at CLS2022, it is also under consideration for publication in the <a href>MIT Computational Law Review</a>. Whether or not to publish a final version prior to that
event or prior to publication in the MIT CLR will depend on the opinions of those two organizations.</p>
<h2 id=abstract>Abstract</h2>
<p>The paper demonstrates an approach to encoding legislation in <a href>OpenFisca</a>, and an approach to using the
OpenFisca API, which in combination can be used to obtain many of the features required for legal expert system development. Those requirements
include explanations that can be tied to legislative justifications, the ability to deal with incomplete inputs, and the ability to calculate
the relevance of inputs to a given conclusion given incomplete information.</p>
<p>The approach set out involves
treating sections of legislation as &ldquo;variables&rdquo; in the OpenFisca encoding, and then duplicating the encoded logic to represent a separate confidence conclusion
for each variable. These two encodings are queried at the same time, and the results combined into a directed graph. The graph can then
be analysed to generate information about relevance, certainty, and to generate legislatively-justified explanations.</p>
<p>The paper briefly contrasts this approach with standard OpenFisca code, typical imperative code,
and declarative logic
encodings. The paper concludes that the additional effort
required to obtain these benefits inside OpenFisca, and
the increased risk to software quality, make the approach
ill-advised in most cases. The paper then argues for the development of open source Rules as Code technologies aimed
specifically at expert system development.</p>
<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<h3 id=background>Background</h3>
<p>Under contract with Canada&rsquo;s Ministry of Employment and Social Development (ESDC), I work full-time as
&ldquo;Director of Rules as Code&rdquo; inside
the Benefit Delivery Modernization (BDM) Programme of Service Canada. <a href>Service Canada</a> is the subdivision of ESDC responsible for the delivery
of many services to Canadians, both in person and online, including a number of important social benefit programs. One such benefit is Old Age Security.</p>
<p>The BDM programme is an effort inside Service Canada to modernize and digitize the delivery of benefits services to Canadians.
It takes an agile and user-research-focussed approach to redeveloping how services are delivered online. My role
in that programme is to find, learn, experiment with, and build open source technologies for Rules as Code to explore its potential as
a foundational technology for the future of digital public service delivery.</p>
<p>As part of that task, I have used an open source Rules as Code tool, <a href=https://openfisca.org>OpenFisca</a>, to encode provisions of the <a href>Old Age Security Act</a>,
in order to test the feasibility of using that code as a legal reasoning resource for a user-facing expert system. This paper discusses the
requirements of that project, and the experience of satisfying those requirements using OpenFisca, which is not designed for powering
expert systems.</p>
<h3 id=rules-as-code>Rules as Code</h3>
<p>Briefly, &ldquo;Rules as Code&rdquo; is a proposed public sector methodology that is intended to improve
the policy development process, the legislative drafting process, service provision, and
to simplify compliance. It calls for the digitization of the semantic meaning of legislation
and regulation as early as possible in its lifespan, in an interdisciplinary way that includes
legal, subject matter, and computing experts.</p>
<p>It emerged from work that was undertaken in New Zealand, and has seen increasing interest,
particularly in commonwealth countries, over the course of the last few years. Recently, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developemnt&rsquo;s Observatory for Public Sector Innovation
released a report on Rules as Code entitled &ldquo;Cracking the Code.&rdquo;
<a href>The executive summary of that report</a> is a convenient resource for people interested in learning more. There is also an open forum for people interested in Rules as Code available at
<a href=https://talk.rulesascode.com>talk.rulesascode.com</a>.</p>
<p>Technologically, Rules as Code can be distinguished from existing practices because it focuses
on isolating the knowledge contained in the legal rules in a way that is re-usable and application
independent. The same encoding of the rules is ideally able to answer any question to which
the rules apply. It is the re-usability of this single encoding across policy development,
legislative drafting, service delivery, and compliance tasks that makes it an attractive
tool for the public sector.</p>
<p>Because the primary thing being modeled is the legislation itself, there is also the opportunity
to encode that legislation in ways that makes the software capable of generating justifications
for its conclusions. Those justifications can refer to the source legal material on which
the code was based, enhancing the transparency and trustworthiness of the resulting systems.</p>
<h3 id=expert-systems>Expert Systems</h3>
<p>The term &ldquo;expert system&rdquo; is one that has changed in usage over time. During the rule-based artificial intelligence wave of the 1980s, an
&ldquo;expert system&rdquo; referred to a tool that encoded the knowledge of an expert, and had two primary capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it had the required facts, it could calculate an answer to a query based on the encoded knowledge, and</li>
<li>if it did not have the required facts, it could determine what facts were relevant, based on the same encoding.</li>
</ul>
<p>These systems were used to build applications, typically written in declarative logic languages, that asked the user one question at a time, and provided the
user with an answer when enough information was known. Many also had the ability to justify how the system had reached
the conclusions using the same encoded knowledge. Because many expert systems encoded knowledge that was heuristic,
or used to guide the interview process, the justifications were not viewed as terribly useful to end-users, and were
used primarily as tools for debugging the applications.</p>
<p>That &ldquo;ask questions, give answers&rdquo; interface has unfortunately been conflated with the technology that enabled it.
As such, the phrase &ldquo;expert system&rdquo; now commonly refers to things that have similar interfaces. It
is frequently used to describe any system that collects relevant information from an end-user,
particularly in a form, or an interview, and answers
a question based on the provided facts and an encoding of expert knowledge, regardless of whether
the same encoding was used to determine relevance as to calculate the answer, or whether relevance
was calculated at all.</p>
<p>I find this change in usage unhelpful. By this revised definition, the difference between a function and an expert system is
that a function is not typically end-user facing.</p>
<p>In this paper, &ldquo;expert system&rdquo; is used to refer not to a user-facing application, but
to a back-end service that is capable of answering questions, justifying those answers, and
answering questions about what inputs are relevant to legal questions, all on the basis of
the same encoding.</p>
<p>While expert systems of the past were typically created
using declarative logic programming approaches, the
underlying technology can be abstracted away from the capabilities of the resulting tool. From the perspective of a
user sending a legal query to a web API endpoint, the language being used by the server to calculate the response is
irrelevant. The definition of &ldquo;expert system&rdquo; used in this paper therefore does not require declarative logic programming. Whether
declarative logic programming is an advisable approach to building legal expert systems is addressed addressed below.</p>
<h3 id=the-eligibility-estimator-prototype-requirements>The Eligibility Estimator Prototype Requirements</h3>
<p>The Eligibility Estimator is a prototype web application under development in BDM. It is a web application that collects relevant
information from a user, and provides information about whether a user qualifies for four benefits implemented under
the Old Age Security Act, why or why not, and if so, in what amount. The team developing this app are using
industry standard approaches to encoding the legislative requirements in order to provide those capabilities.
My task was to parallel that approach by encoding the relevant provisions of the Old Age Security Act in a &ldquo;Rules as Code&rdquo; way, to examine whether that would work as a feasible alternative reasoning tool for this particular application.</p>
<p>The objectives of my alternative encoding were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A single encoding that answers all the relevant questions,</li>
<li>available over a simple Web API,</li>
<li>capable of explaining its answers,</li>
<li>capable of responding to queries with inadequate facts, and advise which additional facts are relevant,</li>
<li>capable of answering questions with uncertain facts that it is not possible to collect, to be able to advise clients
that the answer to their question is contingent on those additional pieces of information,</li>
<li>capable of answering questions as to the eligibility (whether or not the user qualifies) and entitlement (how much
the user qualifies for) with regard to the four benefits outlined in the OAS Act, and</li>
<li>uses a minimal set of inputs, defined by the application developers.</li>
</ul>
<p>While that would be sufficient to demonstrate the usability of the encoding from the perspective of the app
developers, the purpose of the experiment was to examine the viability of using Rules as Code for that purpose.
Rules as Code calls for the encoding of legislation directly, so as to allow for legally-justified explanations
for the conclusions of the system, and for re-use.</p>
<p>In order to test whether the resulting encoding was capable of achieving those objectives also, I
set the following additional objectives for the experiment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explanations should make reference to the legislative authority, and</li>
<li>all of the answers (conclusions, additional relevant questions, etc.) should be generated from the same knowledge
representation of the law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that we might have aimed at encoding the entire OAS Act, as a demonstration that an encoding of the legislation
generally was suitable for the application&rsquo;s specific needs. But this would have made for a considerably larger project. As such, only portions of the OAS Act directly relevant to the eligibility and entitlement questions dealt with
by the app were included in the encoding.</p>
<h2 id=openfisca>OpenFisca</h2>
<p>In order to understand what OpenFisca is, and how it works, it&rsquo;s necessary to take a step back and describe the
problem that it is designed to solve, which is microsimulation.</p>
<h3 id=microsimulation>Microsimulation</h3>
<p>Simulations are often done in government to predict the possible future states of the economy. Consider, for example, the need
for government to analyse how its tax revenues will change in the face of the looming retirement of a large percentage
of their population. Understanding the scale of the problem, and when it is likely to arrive, is something that
can be aided by simulating the economy.</p>
<p>These simulations can be broken down into two categories, macrosimulation, or microsimulation. In macrosimulation,
the things that are represented in the model are abstract macroeconomic indicators, such as inflation rates or gross
domestic product. Rules are applied for how these macroeconomic indicators relate to one another, and how they are
expected to change, and the simulation is run to see what outcomes the model will predict.</p>
<p>Microsimulation, by contrast, models the economy by simulating smaller parts such as individuals, families, households, and firms.
Again, rules are set out that describe how these facts are anticipated to change over time, and how the various
facts relate to one another. The simulation is then run, and the future state of the simulated population is
analysed to learn what might happen.</p>
<p>Microsimulation is used to analyse the effect of tax and benefit rules, and the effects of proposed changes to those
rules. Information about the population and how it is expected to change is included, as are rules about the taxes
and benefits that apply to that population. The microsimulation can then
be run with various rule encodings to see what the effect of those policies might be on individuals, or
in aggregate.</p>
<p>In some jurisdictions, this sort of analysis is a legal prerequisite for the adoption of tax and benefit legislation.
Microsimulation provides a convenient way to meet those legal prerequisites. There are also some legal requirements,
such as maximum marginal tax rates, that are difficult to calculate across
a wide variety of fact scenarios. Using a microsimulation with randomly generated populations of sufficient size
can provide comfort that a proposed legislative change does not violate those sorts of legal constraints.</p>
<p>Microsimulation poses some particular technological challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>it requires a large number of calculations to be applied to a large number of entities, repeatedly;</li>
<li>the more calculations you can perform, and the faster you can do it, the more accurate your simulation may be;</li>
<li>it needs to be able to deal with how populations and rules change over time; and</li>
<li>it needs to be able to compare the results of different versions of the same rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>The target users of microsimulations are usually data scientists. However, any system that is capable of calculating
the effect of a tax or benefit policy change on tens of thousands of people is also capable of calculating the effect
with regard to one person. Code generated for microsimulation is therefore also re-usable to generate
user-facing applications that help people understand the effects of existing and proposed rules.</p>
<h3 id=open-source-microsimulation-in-openfisca>Open Source Microsimulation in OpenFisca</h3>
<p>OpenFisca is an open source platform, built in the Python programming language, for generating microsimulations of
national tax and benefit systems. It has a number of features that are designed to solve some of the technical
challenges associated with microsimulation, and to do so in an open source context so as to promote
transparency and accountability.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that OpenFisca encodings are capable of processing large quantities of data as quickly as
possible, OpenFisca uses vectorial computing. All variables are presumed to be an arbitrarily long list of
values, and operations are performed against these vectors, not against the values individually. All values in
OpenFisca are also presumed to change over the additional dimension of time. Rules are implemented by describing
the periods of time to which they apply, and all values are calculated as per a given point in time or period of
time. This makes it easier to specify how rules have changed over time, and to ask questions about dates in
the past and dates in the future.</p>
<p>For the most part, vector computation and temporal logic are hidden from the user, making it easier to describe
how values are calculated as if you were calculating for a specific entity at a specific point in time. OpenFisca then does the work
of extrapolating how to calculate that same value at any given point in time, and for a large number of entities,
automatically.</p>
<p>OpenFisca also has features that allow the developer to parameterize rules, and to specify changes to those parameters
separately from the rules themselves. This is useful for expressing, for example, how tax rates and brackets have
changed over time. Beyond that, OpenFisca also allows the user to describe alternative versions of the rules that
go deeper than just parameters, called &ldquo;reforms&rdquo;. A query can then be run with or without any proposed reform
included in the rules, to see how the proposal changes the results.</p>
<p>OpenFisca comes with a number of tools to facilitate the development of these encodings, including testing tools,
and a system of automatically deploying an OpenFisca encoding as a RESTful Web API. The API provides two primary
endpoints, <code>/calculate</code> and <code>/trace</code>, where the latter is used for debugging the results of a calculation. There
is also a legislation explorer that can be used to automatically generate a web interface for making requests
against an OpenFisca API, as well as tools for automatically generating Swagger documentation for the encoded
systems.</p>
<p>OpenFisca has also been extended by other projects. Noteworthy is the Legislation Explorer, which
creates a generic web interface allowing people to change inputs and parameters and make calculations, and the Policy Engine project, which looks to build more user-friendly interfaces
for the same thing on the basis of OpenFisca encodings.</p>
<p>OpenFisca has been used to power tools such as Mes Aides and LexImpact in France, Les meves adjudes in Barcelona, Rapu Ture in New Zealand.</p>
<p>OpenFisca organizes its code by country, and open source country packages with varying levels
of quality and coverage have been created for France, Italy, Mali, Aotearoa New Zealand, Senegal,
Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and Uruguay, and sub-national areas like Barcelona and New South
Wales. Work is underway by the developers of Policy Engine on a United States package, also.</p>
<h3 id=why-use-openfisca>Why Use OpenFisca?</h3>
<p>OpenFisca was selected for use inside BDM in a number of projects that pre-date my involvement.
ESDC and the Canada School of Public Service have collaborated over the last few years on Rules as Code
discovery projects that used OpenFisca with departments including Fisheries and Oceans, and Labour. That important
work continues, and we continue to contribute to it as part of my role within BDM.</p>
<p>The motivations of selecting OpenFisca for the Eligibility Estimator demonstration include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a desire to build on that existing knowledge and experience,</li>
<li>a desire to use a mature tool that has been successfully deployed elsewhere in similar circumstances,</li>
<li>the desire to use open source technologies in accordance with the direction of the Government of Canada,</li>
<li>the desire to use open source technologies because of the implications for algorithmic accountability in Rules as Code in particular,</li>
<li>the need for a tool specific to the encoding of benefits legislation,</li>
<li>good documentation, and</li>
<li>the availability of support from the helpful and growing OpenFisca community online.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of writing, I am aware of no preferable alternatives given these objectives.</p>
<p>Had there been viable alternatives, red tape would have been a significant factor.
Obtaining approval to use new software technologies in ESDC is a time-consuming, complicated, and unpredictable process that moves
at what used to be called a &ldquo;glacial&rdquo; pace, but given the realities of climate change is probably better now described as &ldquo;tectonic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>OpenFisca, as a tool that had already seen considerable use in the department, and as a library for
an already-approved interpreted programming language (i.e. Python), would have had an almost insurmountable advantage over any tools
without those features in the context of any short-term project.</p>
<h2 id=typical-openfisca-code>Typical OpenFisca Code</h2>
<p>In this section I will briefly introduce a toy example of how a simple rule might be encoded in OpenFisca, and then give an explanation
of why this style of encoding is not, in and of itself, sufficient for powering expert systems.</p>
<h3 id=entities-variables-and-parameters>Entities, Variables, and Parameters</h3>
<p>The basic structure of an OpenFisca encoding is divided between entities, variables, and parameters.</p>
<p>An entity is a type of object that will be simulated, such as an individual, a household, a family, or a firm. Typically, the number of entities
required is relatively small. Many encodings can be done creating only an &ldquo;individual&rdquo; entity.</p>
<p>A variable is a thing that you can either specify or derive about an entity. OpenFisca doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between the two. If you specify
a value, OpenFisca will use it. If you do not, and you have described how the variable can be calculated, it will attempt to calculate the value
for you if required. A variable has zero or more formulas, each of which is used to calculate that variable for a given period of time. If you
are not concerned with time, you can define one variable that defines the variable at all points in time.</p>
<p>A parameter is a scalar value set out in the relevant rules that might change over time without there being changes to the rest of the rules.
It may be a tax rate, an entitlement amount, or the age of majority.</p>
<h3 id=age-birth-date-minor>Age, Birth Date, Minor</h3>
<p>As an example, let&rsquo;s assume that there is a law that defines a minor as someone under the age of 18. You want to build an application that
can accept a birth date, and calculate whether the person is a minor.</p>
<p>The first step is to set out the relevant entities. In this case, the only entity type we are concerned with is &ldquo;Individual.&rdquo;</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#75715e># This is the code for building a person entity</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now that we have defined the entity, we need to define three variables: <code>birth_date</code> will hold information about what day the person was born,
<code>age</code> will hold information about their current age, and <code>is_minor</code> will hold information about whether they are legally a minor. Here is how those
variables would be defined.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-python data-lang=python>age
</code></pre></div><p>Note that the encoding of <code>age</code> specifies that the relevant time period is &ldquo;DAY&rdquo;, whereas the encoding of <code>birth_date</code> says that the relevant time
period is &ldquo;ETERNITY&rdquo;. This is how you explain to OpenFisca that a person has only one <code>birth_date</code>, and it never changes, but their <code>age</code> might
be different on one day from the day previous. Similarly, whether or not they are a minor depends on their age, so it can also change from day
to day. The definition of <code>birth_date</code> has no formula, which means that for OpenFisca to know anything about a persons' <code>birth_date</code> it will
need to be provided by the user. On the other had <code>age</code> has a formula which can be used to calculate the person&rsquo;s age based on their <code>birth_date</code>.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-python data-lang=python>minor
</code></pre></div><p>In our formula for calculating whether or not the person is a minor, we make reference to a parameter, the <code>age_of_majority</code>. That parameter
is defined elsewhere, in a YAML file, as follows.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-python data-lang=python>age_of_majority
</code></pre></div><p>With these encodings, we can deploy our code to an API. OpenFisca greatly simplifies the task of generating an API
capable of handling these queries. Once the encoding is complete, a web server with the relevant end points can
be started by executing the following commands:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>how to start the API server
</code></pre></div><p>Once the API server is running, any user can send a POST query to the <code>/calculate</code> end point with a query in the
following format.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>query</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Facts that are known are specified, including the date for which they are known. Queries are expressed by including
facts and setting their value to <code>null</code>.</p>
<p>If the user sends the above query to the OpenFisca API <code>/calculate</code> endpoint, they receive the following response.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>response</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If we sent an under-specified query, with no age and no birth date, like this:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>no</span> <span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>info</span>
</code></pre></div><p>we receive this as a response:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-json data-lang=json><span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>no</span> <span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>answer</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This shows an important feature of OpenFisca for expert system development. If a value is not provided for a variable,
and that value cannot be calculated, OpenFisca treats that value as though it&rsquo;s numerical representation were
zero. If the value is boolean, OpenFisca will presume it is false. If the value is a date, OpenFisca will
presume the date is January 1, 1970. If it is a number, OpenFisca will presume it is zero, and if it is a string,
OpenFisca will presume it is an empty string.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to represent the concept of an &ldquo;unknown&rdquo; value when dealing with normal OpenFisca code.</p>
<h2 id=using-openfisca-to-power-expert-systems>Using OpenFisca to Power Expert Systems</h2>
<p>OpenFisca provides users with a way to calculate the answers to multiple questions, and to expose legislative encodings over an API.
It does not explain its answers, or link the explanations to legislative source material for the encoding.
It also doesn&rsquo;t have anyway to distinguish between &ldquo;zero,&rdquo; and &ldquo;unknown.&rdquo; That in turn means that it can&rsquo;t even tell when it
hasn&rsquo;t been provided with all the relevant information, what other information might be relevant, or what facts a conclusion is
contingent on.</p>
<p>All of those features can be obtained in the following way.</p>
<h3 id=using-trace-results>Using <code>/trace</code> Results</h3>
<p>OpenFisca provides an alternative endpoint called <code>/trace</code>, which is intended for use in debugging.</p>
<p>Trace output includes the same answers as provided by <code>/calculate</code>, but with additional information as
to all of the variables that were calculated, and for each variable, the other variables and parameters
on which that calculation was dependent. This information is provided as a dictionary of variables, with
their dependencies and calculated values listed for each entity in the query.</p>
<p>The approach we use is to change our OpenFisca encoding so as to get the required information into the trace
output, and then to post-process the trace output in order to retrieve it.</p>
<h3 id=legislative-parts-sub-parts-conditions-and-conclusions-are-all-variables>Legislative Parts, Sub-Parts, Conditions, and Conclusions are all &ldquo;Variables&rdquo;</h3>
<p>In order to generate explanations that are linked to legislative source material, we need the source material
to be represented in the trace output. That requires implementing the parts of the legislation as OpenFisca
variables.</p>
<p>In our example, a simple depedency tree explaining how <code>is_minor</code> is calculated would look like this:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-text data-lang=text>is_minor
 - age
</code></pre></div><p>There are two problems with this tree. The first is that it doesn&rsquo;t make any reference to legislative materials.
That can be resolved by renaming <code>is_minor</code> to something like <code>is_minor_according_to_majority_act_s_1</code>. But if
we did that, we would know that the variable <code>age</code> mattered in some way to making that determination, but we
would have no idea how. We can solve that problem by adding another variable between them that explains how the elements were being used.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-text data-lang=text>is_minor_according_to_majority_act_s_1
  - age_is_below_age_of_majority
    - age
</code></pre></div><p>Note that in our example, there is only
one statutory explanation possible for why a person is a minor. Often, that will not be the case, and adding legislative elements will also
require the addition of additional layers of variables. For instance, if being a minor could be legally inferred either due to the majority
act or a second piece of legislation, we would need variables for <code>is_minor</code>, <code>is_minor_according_to_majority_act_s1</code>, <code>is_minor_according_to_other_act_s1</code>,
<code>age_is_below_age_of_majority</code>, and <code>age</code>, along with whatever other variables are used by the other act.</p>
<p>The generalized strategy is that sections of legislation, their sub-sections, their logical conditions, and their conclusions (when the conclusions are not identical to the legislative section), are all implemented as variables
in the OpenFisca encoding.</p>
<p>You
may also need to create variables to represent unnamed sub-sections of a named section of law when
knowing whether and how those unnamed sub-sections applied is relevant to the user.</p>
<p>By way of example, the OAS Act includes provisions which can be satisfied in
one way for residents, and in another way for non-residents. The rules for both appear inside a single numbered paragraph. Which set of rules applies, and whether it was satisfied, and why, may be important information for
the user to have. As such, some variables in this approach also represent unnamed sub-parts of legislative clauses.</p>
<h3 id=encoding-confidence>Encoding Confidence</h3>
<p>Once we have reformulated our encoding to add variables for all of the legislative parts, sub-parts, conditions, and conclusions, we are left with
the problem that OpenFisca doesn&rsquo;t actually know what it knows, because it does not know what it has been told, and what it is simply assuming.</p>
<p>The solution to that problem is to take our list of variables, and duplicate each variable with another variable with the word &ldquo;_known&rdquo; at the end of
its name. This &ldquo;known&rdquo; variable will track information about what the system has been told, and what the system has confidently derived.</p>
<p>In our <code>is_minor</code> example, we would now have the following list of variables:</p>
<ul>
<li>is_minor_according_to_majority_act_s1</li>
<li>is_minor_according_to_majority_act_s1_known</li>
<li>age_is_below_age_of_majority</li>
<li>age_is_below_age_of_majority_known</li>
<li>age</li>
<li>age_known</li>
<li>birth_date</li>
<li>birth_date_known</li>
</ul>
<p>Each &ldquo;known&rdquo; variable is then given a formula for determining when we can be confident about the answer that OpenFisca has generated. In this case,
the formula is not complicated. Whether the person is a minor according to the majority act is known if the only factor it depends on is also known.
Likewise for whether age is below the age of majority. That is known if we know the age, and we can presume that we know the age of majority because
it is a parameter. The person&rsquo;s age is known if their birth date is known, and their birth date is known only if the user says so, so it does not
have a formula.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-python data-lang=python><span style=color:#75715e>#Example of formulas</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This structure gives the user the ability to say what the birth date is, and whether or not they are confident of that information. If they are not
confident in that information, whether they are a minor will be calculated in the usual way, that lack of confidence
is carried forward to other variables that depend on it.</p>
<p>Writing these formulas for the &ldquo;known&rdquo; variables takes some careful consideration. Frequently, a variable will be calculated on a conjunction, or a disjunction, or a combination of the two. Take for example a situation where a person is entitled to a benefit if they are a minor, and a citizen. When is <code>entitled_to_a_benefit</code> &ldquo;known?&rdquo; It is known
as soon as any of the conjoined elements is both known and false, because at that point, the conjunction is also known to be false. It is also known if both values are
known, regardless whether they are true or false. This leads to formulas like the following in &ldquo;known&rdquo; variables.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:2;-o-tab-size:2;tab-size:2><code class=language-python data-lang=python>known <span style=color:#66d9ef>if</span> either_false <span style=color:#f92672>or</span> both_known
</code></pre></div><p>Similarly disjunctions are known if any of the disjunctive elements are known true, or if all of the elements are known. The complexity of these &ldquo;known&rdquo; formulas
seems to grow exponentially with the number of variables referred to in the substantive variable, which acts as another motivator to break complicated variables
into simpler ones.</p>
<h3 id=post-processing-the-results-of-openfisca-queries>Post-Processing the Results of OpenFisca Queries</h3>
<p>Once we have made these changes to our encoding, we can send a request to the API with the relevant inputs and &ldquo;known&rdquo; variables. If something is presumed,
we set it to its presumed value, and set &ldquo;known&rdquo; to false. We query the substantive conclusion we are interested in, and the &ldquo;known&rdquo; equivalent for it, and
we send the request to the <code>/trace</code> endpoint, so that we will get the information from which we can build the explanation tree.</p>
<p>We then use the following algorithm to build a single dependency graph from the information in the response to both the substantive variable and the associated known variable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directed graph.</li>
<li>For each variable included in the response, add a node to the directed graph, with the value calculated.</li>
<li>For each variable referred to as a factor in calculating a variable in the response, create an edge from the conclusion to the factor.</li>
<li>For each variable in the graph, find the corresponding &ldquo;known&rdquo; variable for each node in the graph, and annotate the node with the value of the &ldquo;known&rdquo; variable.</li>
</ol>
<p>The result is a graph of variables with names, calculated values, and true-or-false &ldquo;known&rdquo; values, linked by
their dependency relationships.</p>
<p>This graph can now be used to generate explanations, determine relevant inputs, and calculate whether answers are contingently true, in the following ways.</p>
<h4 id=generate-an-explanation>Generate An Explanation</h4>
<p>To generate an explanation, generate a tree from the graph using the variable you are interested in as the root node. For each element in the tree,
include the substantive explanation and whether it is known, and display it to the user.</p>
<p>Because OpenFisca&rsquo;s <code>\trace</code> includes information about which
were the query variables (variables that were set to <code>null</code> in the request), generating explanations can be done automatically for all query variables that are not &ldquo;known&rdquo; variables.</p>
<h4 id=determine-relevant-inputs>Determine Relevant Inputs</h4>
<p>To determine what inputs are relevant, first, generate the explanation for the variable you are interested in. If the root variable is &ldquo;known&rdquo;, there are no other relevant inputs.
If the root variable is not &ldquo;known&rdquo;, find all leaf nodes that do not have a &ldquo;known&rdquo; ancestor. Those are the relevant inputs. Note that this method assumes that only
leaf nodes are being collected from the user. In a situation where you are happy to ask, for example, either the person&rsquo;s age, or their birth date, then the &ldquo;relevant&rdquo; inputs
are all the nodes with no known ancestor.</p>
<p>This provides the application with a list of relevant nodes, but doesn&rsquo;t advise the application on how to prioritize
displaying them to the user.</p>
<h4 id=answer-contingent-questions>Answer Contingent Questions</h4>
<p>To answer a contingent questions subject to assumptions, first, determine the relevant inputs for the target query. Then get the list of variables that your application can collect from the user.
If none of the relevant inputs are inputs that your application can collect, the
answer provided in the explanation is contingent on the relevant inputs' assumed values being correct.</p>
<h3 id=old-age-security-act-example>Old Age Security Act Example</h3>
<p>The approach described above was used to encode portions of the Old Age Security Act. That encoding
is available at <a href=https://github.com/JasonMorrisSC/openfisca-canada>https://github.com/JasonMorrisSC/openfisca-canada</a>. At the time of writing, that code is also deployed publicly at <a href=https://offnet.etc.etc..com>https://offnet.etc.etc..com</a>.</p>
<p>An example of a middle-layer server that uses the above encoding and post-processes the trace results
to provide explanations, relevance and contingent responses, is implemented in <a href>a Google Colab notebook
available online</a>. A video demonstrating the conversation that might happen between a user-facing
application and that middle-layer service appears here.</p>
<p>TODO: YouTube Video</p>
<h2 id=analysis-of-using-openfisca-for-expert-system-development>Analysis of Using OpenFisca for Expert System Development</h2>
<p>Dealing with OpenFisca&rsquo;s vectorization of calculations is awkward. While being familiar with Python is
an advantage, it is not as strong an advantage as you would expect unless you are also familiar with
the mathematical library NumPy.
Standard Python keywords like <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>if</code> do not work as you would naively assume
when dealing with vectors, which makes the task of writing encodings in OpenFisca challenging.
The need to always annotate input and output data and parameters with dates is also a frustrating
but understandable annoyance. I anticipate these things would fade into the background with time spent
working with OpenFisca code. Those are also problems that exist before applying the approach described
above.</p>
<p>My impression of having used OpenFisca to power a legal expert system was disappointing.
It satisfied the requirements of
the experiment, but my impression was that the above approach resulted in code that
was long, repetitive, riskier and less useful than code written in other approaches.</p>
<h3 id=rules-as-code-v-application-development>Rules as Code v Application Development</h3>
<p>Recall that application development and Rules as Code
are not the same thing. Analyzing whether or not OpenFisca, or any particular approach to the
use of OpenFisca, is an appropriate tool for Rules as Code generally is a very different question
from deciding whether or not it is a good idea with regard to a given application.</p>
<p>Encoding an entire piece of legislation so that it can be used both by your application
and arbitrary others is, in economic terms, a public good. The benefits received by the other
users of your encoded law is a positive externality that imposes costs on the current
development project that are impossible to recoup. Rules as Code is therefore almost
never going to be a good idea when viewed from the context of the development of a single application.</p>
<p>But that is not the right context. Rules as Code is public administration infrastructure.
Tools and techniques for Rules as Code need to be evaluated in that context. The question that this
paper seeks to address is not whether or not we should &ldquo;do&rdquo; Rules as Code. Rather, if we have
decided to do it, and we have decided that we want it to be explainable, justified by reference to
the source legislation, capable of understanding incomplete facts, and advising as to relevance;
what are the advantages and disadvantages of the above approach to using
OpenFisca as compared other alternatives, available or anticipated?</p>
<h3 id=declarative-alternatives-we-need-dont-yet-exist>Declarative Alternatives We Need Don&rsquo;t Yet Exist</h3>
<p>I will talk below about the comparison between the experience of using OpenFisca and using declarative
logic programming for generating expert systems. It&rsquo;s important to say up front that in this context, declarative
logic solutions for rules as code are &ldquo;anticipated&rdquo;, and not &ldquo;available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I base the arguments below on my experiences using declarative logic encodings for Rules as Code as
part of my work at SMU Centre for Computational Law, in the development of Blawx, and during my LLM
thesis work at the University of Alberta. In future papers I would like to do an apples-to-apples
comparison between imperative and declarative approaches applied to precisely the same computational
task. This is not that paper.</p>
<p>That said, even if I am to be believed about the benefits of declarative encodings, there are currently
no open source tools based on declarative logic that have high quality documentation,
allow for easy deployment of code to web APIs, and have all of the explainability and reasoning features described
above. As might be expected, the most feature-rich offerings are commercial software. Public sector
software procurement practices are moving away from commercial software offerings in favour of open
source technology. Open source technology provides a degree of transparency as to the encodings
that is not available with commercial products, and which is critical for trustworthiness in the public
sphere.</p>
<p>None of the current open source offerings for declarative logic programming
offer the ease of use and documentation and support that
would be required to make them feasible for mission-critical deployment in the public sector.</p>
<p>As part of my work with the Canada School of Public Service I&rsquo;m actively working on a revised version of
Blawx with many of the needed features. That software is currently in version 1.0.6-alpha.
Work on L4 at Singapore Management University Centre for Computational
Law continues, and there may be others.</p>
<p>Other non-logical declarative approaches, such as the Catala language, which is based in
functional programming, may eventually fill this need in the open source space. But as of today,
there is nothing that fits the bill, and is ready-to-deploy.</p>
<p>My comments here are therefore not to suggest that people working in Rules as Code should use something
particular instead of OpenFisca. Indeed, even if such tools existed, they might be ill-suited to
the task of microsimulation.
Rather, my comments are intended to advocate for expanding our toolkit of Rules as Code technologies to include things that are specifically aimed at expert system
development.</p>
<h3 id=code-length>Code Length</h3>
<p>Comparing the encoding of the knowledge in an entire law with the encoding of the knowledge in a law
required for answering a specific type of question is an &ldquo;apples and oranges&rdquo; affair. That said,
if you compare the code length of all of the available approaches, both Rules as Code and status quo,
the shortest code length is in the status quo. I would estimate the difference to be in the range of
a factor of 10. It&rsquo;s hard to overstate the advantages for development time when you know in advance
what question you need to answer, what inputs you will have, and what outputs you care to provide.</p>
<p>I mention this not to applaud the status quo. The status quo remains extremely risky in terms of
legal compliance, duplicative of effort, and inconsistent in results.
I mention it to make clear to Rules as Code advocates how steep the uphill battle
is to convince people to adopt Rules as Code as an approach to application development.
Application development is a use-case for encoded legislation, but it is not a reason to write those
encodings. For Rules as Code to be a good idea inside the context of an application development process,
the application would need to be astronomically complicated, or the encoding of the law
<em>would need to already exist</em>. The latter is more realistic, and that&rsquo;s the approach I think we should pursue.</p>
<p>With regard to the approach described above there is no way to avoid the conclusion that using OpenFisca
this way involves writing an enormous amount of code, much of which is boilerplate, and repetitive. In particular, the need to duplicate the logic of the encoding in order
to calculate certainty results in a more-than doubling of the lines of code required. It is theoretically
possible that some of that work could be automated, by generating the confidence code from the code
for the other variables, but the difference is still stark.</p>
<p>Let me provide an anecdotal example. I used a declarative logic programming language called s(CASP)
to encode a section of Singapore legislation last year with SMU Centre for Computational Law.
The ratio of lines of code to words in the legislative text was 0.5. Every two words of legislation resulted in a line of code. When I did
the same calculation for this work in OpenFisca, the ratio was 2. And at the time I did the calculation the code was unfinished, so the real ratio
for the OAS code was ultimately going to be higher.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s more than a four-fold increase in lines of code using the approach
described above as opposed to a declarative encoding.
Even if you could automatically generate the confidence code, it is still more than
a two-fold increase.</p>
<p>In the langauge of &ldquo;return on investment&rdquo; the length of the code is an investment. To know whether
OpenFisca is better than other alternatives, we also need to measure the return.
Unfortunately, the only place I can find
where using the OpenFisca method gives a greater return that alternatives is in processing speed
with large data inputs, which is not usually a marginal factor in expert system development.
Meanwhile, several capabilities available in other methods still don&rsquo;t exist in this approach to OpenFisca.</p>
<h3 id=imperative-vs-declarative-logic>Imperative vs. Declarative Logic</h3>
<p>One of the things that you lose by virtue of using an imperative programming language instead of a declarative
language is the ability to reverse the reasoning.</p>
<p>Imperative functions for calculating
variables go in only one direction, from inputs to outputs, and cannot be automatically reversed.</p>
<p>Declarative logic programming, by contrast, allows you to specify relationships, and then use them
in both directions.</p>
<p>An equivalent declarative logic programming encoding of the OAS rules might allow for asking
abstract reasoning questions, like &ldquo;are there any circumstances in which a person qualifies for GIS and
lives outside of Canada?&rdquo; The logic required to answer that question starts at the conclusion - whether the person qualifies for GIS - and works backward to the inputs that can lead to that conclusion.</p>
<p>With the approach described above, the only way to get an answer to that question would be to
randomly generate a large population, and test it to see whether or not that situation arises.
And even then, you don&rsquo;t know that it is impossible, you just know you didn&rsquo;t find any examples of it.</p>
<p>So while OpenFisca code can be written in such a way as to get some of the features of declarative code
alternatives, it is still not capable of everything that the much shorter declarative
encoding would have been able to do.</p>
<h3 id=dont-repeat-yourself>Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself</h3>
<p>In addition to the cost of additional lines of code, there is a negative consequence for
software reliability. Every line of code is an opportunity for another bug. Given the complexity
of the formula used for calculating &ldquo;known&rdquo; values in the above method, we are caught between
a rock and a hard place. Either we simplify the variables to the point where the formulas for
whether or not they are known are simple, and we multiply the number of variables we are encoding,
or we leave ourselves with more complicated variable definitions and significantly increase the risk
of errors in how the &ldquo;known&rdquo; variables are being calculated.</p>
<p>This is particularly frustrating when all of the information that is required
to generate the formulas for the known variables was available when we wrote the original variable&rsquo;s formula. With limited exceptions, it could be done automatically.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion-openfisca-alone-is-not-enough>Conclusion: OpenFisca Alone Is Not Enough</h2>
<p>Open Fisca clearly belongs in Rules as Code toolbox. If you need microsimulation,
it is an excellent option. If you need microsimulation, and you don&rsquo;t need things like explanations, legal
justification, relevance, and dealing with incomplete facts, it is also a reasonable way to build simple web apps.</p>
<p>But my experience using it suggests that if you do need those extra things, or if you are trying to build a generalized encoding
for people who might, OpenFisca is suboptimal. It can be forced to behave sort of like
an expert system engine, but the effort and risk involved is needlessly high.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t need microsimulation or temporal reasoning features at all, OpenFisca is probably not the best alternative.
Using it is slightly more difficult because of the temporal and vectorial features.</p>
<p>This paper does not address the alternative
of attempting to make declarative code behave like a microsimulator, but my instinct is that it would be similarly
difficult, if it is even feasible. Declarative logic programming
languages are famous for their expressiveness, not their computational efficiency. Declarative
functional languages like Catala would likely be better suited to that task, but exploring Catala
for use in expert systems remains future work.</p>
<p>What seems obvious to me from the experience of having used both OpenFisca and declarative methods is that
microsimulation and declarative logic reasoning are things that are more powerful in combination than either is alone.</p>
<p>With both, you could use the declarative encoding with subject matter experts to verify it matches their expectations.
That is arguably easier to do with declarative code, because declarative code matches the structure of the source rules much better. Then,
the declarative encoding could be used to generate tests for microsimulation projects. If the microsimulation
code passes all the of the tests generated by the declarative code, then it is consistent with the declarative code,
which in turn is consistent with the experts' expectations. If a test fails, the declarative code can be used to
generate an explanation for why the result that was generated was not correct, and why the result that was expected is
correct. That would be a boon to quality assurance in developing legal applications generally.
In terms of microsimulation code, it would allow us to better demonstrate legal accuracy without making any sacrifice of efficiency.</p>
<p>Rather than cram microsimulator-shaped pegs into expert-system-shaped holes, the Rules as Code movement
would be better served to invest in declarative expert system tools designed specifically for
legal reasoning tasks.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the maintainers of OpenFisca for their valuable and important tool.
I would like to thank the members of the OpenFisca community who have and continue to assist me in figuring out how to
get OpenFisca to do things it wasn&rsquo;t designed to do. I would also like to thank the members of the Eligibility Estimator
team for their help in understanding their use case and their needs, and for having done the work of encoding the status
quo version before I even got started. I would also like to thank the organizers of the Computational Legal Studies
Conference for hosting the conference, supporting the academic field of Computational Law, and creating forums for conversations
around topics like Rules as Code.</p>
