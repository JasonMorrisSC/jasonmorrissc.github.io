Code vs. No-Code
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
There was a conversation on Twitter this week that helped to clarify my thinking about something, and I wanted to share.
There is a sort of tension between &ldquo;code&rdquo; and &ldquo;no-code&rdquo; (sometimes &ldquo;low-code&rdquo;) solutions.
People who consider themselves software developers see people trying to use no-code solutions to do things that the no-code solutions are not good at, and they get frustrated that the capabilities of those tools has been overestimated.

Progress on Blawx Just a quick note to let you know what I&rsquo;ve been doing with Blawx over the last few weeks.
Blawx was originally a single web page that could contain a single workspace of code, much like an IDE that could only have one file open at a time. Version 1 changed that by creating &ldquo;workspaces&rdquo; that are saved server-side, and giving you the ability to create multiple workspaces and edit each one separately.

Legal Documents in Blawx, Take 2

Background A couple of blog posts ago I talked about how I was working on a way of getting information about statutes into Blawx, so that they could be used for generating explanations, cross-references, and links to source material.
Playing around with it that way gave me what I needed to know in terms of the data structure that I needed to fill, but it also taught me that the block-based interface was painful for drafting rules.

What is Blawx? Blawx is an open source, web-based, user-friendly tool for Rules as Code. It allows you to take what you know about laws, regulations, or contracts, and describe them to the computer in a simple but powerful block-based visual language.
In September of 2020 it was awarded second place in the startup category of the American Legal Technology Awards.

I&rsquo;ve been spending some time recently working on adding a way to describe legal documents to the development version of Blawx.com.
Objectives Big picture, I want to have a data structure inside Blawx that is going to allow people to cite the authority for rules using a specific reference, as pictured here:
Importing The structure should allow the user to add to and modify information imported from a structured source, such as a LegalDocML file.

Chris Bailey&rsquo;s ProLaLa 2022 Presentation As I mentioned in the last blog post, Chris Bailey&rsquo;s presentation at ProLaLa 2022 sort of requires its own blog post in response.

Chris is a law student at the University of Illinois, and spoke about creating a library of encoded legal components that would be useable for formal verification-like tasks or software development tasks, both.

Avoiding the Clause Order Hassle in s(CASP)

The Clause Order Hassle Learning to use s(CASP) to encode legislation over the course of the last year or so has been at times frustrating. The reason for that is that I would often find myself with code that did not work as expected, and I could not understand why. Then, I would make changes, usually by changing the order of the lines of code, or by changing the number of predicates I was using, and the code would start to work.

I&rsquo;ve been playing around with an s(CASP) library for doing date math over the last little while, and finally found some time today to test it with s(CASP)&rsquo;s ability to do constraints over reals. I was interested to see if there was a way that we could convert the dates into timestamps and then have s(CASP) treat them as a constraint.
The Problem Here&rsquo;s my imaginary scenario. I am allowed to do something on any day that is in both the first and last 200 days of 2021.

Here we go again! In what risks becoming an annual tradition, around here, I&rsquo;ve decided to move the Rules as Code Diary away from Medium into a self-hosted blog built with hugo.
This is mainly motivated by the fact that a lot of what I&rsquo;m writing these days is actually code, and Medium is pretty limited in terms of what it can do to display code typed into the editor. Hugo, on the other hand, will show you more or less whatever I can type into a markdown document, with syntax highlighting.

Following up on the plan I wrote about a few days ago… By exposing all of the intermediate conclusions, and by adding separate variables that represent whether the primary variables are “known,” I’ve managed to create an encoding in OpenFisca that is capable of doing some cool stuff over the Web API.
You can see the source code in this GitHub repository, and the demos/explanations.py file demonstrates the use of the OpenFisca Web API with my rules as code encoding in Python.

OpenFisca is a leading Rules as Code solution, but it is primarily aimed at microsimulation. Microsimulation is where you create a data model that represents small elements of a population, like people and households, and then encode the effects of different tax and benefit regimes.

Just had a great conversation with a colleague that helped me understand a challenges involved in implementing Rules as Code that hadn’t occured to me before.
The objective in Rules as Code is to write an encoding of the legislation that is as re-usable as possible. That means avoiding the temptation to put things into the encoding of the rules that only make sense to include in the context of a particular application.

What is Google Colab(oratory)? Google Colab is a web-based implementation of Jupyter notebooks-a “literate programming” tool for the Python programming language-and Google’s cloud services.

Rules as Code is a movement in public administration that suggests that the digitization of legislation, regulation, and other rules should happen as early in their life cycle as possible, so as to improve policy design, improve legislative drafting, and massively simplify service automation and building software systems compliant with those rules.
It is an international movement, and it is an interdisciplinary movement. It impacts on people inside government, legislatures, regulatory bodies, regulated entities, academia, as well as technologists, lawyers, and more.

Since then I have written about using s(CASP) to encode Covid-19 rules using basic event calculus, I wrote about how it is my new favourite tool for Rules as Code, I’ve written about what it is, and why that matters for Rules as Code, about how you can use it to make laws better, and I introduced a new tool for user-facing legal expert systems powered by s(CASP) encodings of rules, and published an extended abstract in the ICAIL ’21 proceedings based on an encoding done in s(CASP).

Perhaps the most interesting part of the first day of ICAIL 2021 proper is a presentation by Dr. Alice Witt, entitled Converting Copyright Legislation into Machine-Executable Code: Interpretation, Coding Validation and Legal Alignment. The presentation is available on YouTube here.
Let me first say that this is the first time that I have seen a paper on Rules as Code at ICAIL, and it is nice to see it getting the attention that it deserves in that forum.

ICAIL is the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law. It is held bi-annually, and it is currently being “hosted” virtually in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
You can “attend” it virtually by going to the Associação Lawgorithm youtube channel and following along with the live presentations today, tomorrow, and Thursday.
On the Monday and Friday of the conference there are typically a number of parallel workshops. Yesterday I followed along with the Explainable and Responsible AI in Law workshop, which was very interesting.

“Rules as Code” Extended Abstract to appear in ICAIL ’21 Proceedings

The International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law is a renowned international academic conference on law and artificial intelligence. It is held every two years.
In 2019, I had the pleasure of attending in order to present a demonstration of work that was part of my LLM in Computational Law at the University of Alberta.
I’m happy to share that I will be “attending” again this year. ICAIL ’21 will be publishing an extended abstract of mine, which is one level above a demonstration.

Today at SMU CCLaw we had a seminar from Dr. Joaquín Arias Herrero of the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos in Spain. Dr. Arias is one of the researchers responsible for s(CASP), which is my new favourite programming language for Rules as Code.
I was delighted to learn about the existence of s(CASP) late last year. I have been spending a lot of time working in it in the first half of 2021, and that delight has not diminished.

How Rules as Code Makes Laws Better
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I want to give you an intuition for why Rules as Code in logical tools like s(CASP) makes laws better.
Let’s imagine that you are the legal knowledge engineer assigned to the Rules as Code process for drafting the Rock Paper Scissors Act of 2021. The purpose of the Rock Paper Scissors Act is to set out the official rules of who is the winner of a game of Rock Paper Scissors.

The International Law Lab Showcase is an online meetup of innovation and technology labs at law schools around the world. It is an opportunity for the members of these labs to meet one another, and for people interested in how these innovative institutions operate to come ask questions.
If you are interested in attending a law school with an innovation and technology lab, or if you are a law school interested in starting one, this is where you should be.

Introducing L4-Docassemble
</a>
</h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
At SMU’s Centre for Computational Law we are working on an open source domain specific language for law, called L4. The idea is that you should be able to write legal rules, like laws or contracts, in L4, and other applications should be able to translate that encoding into other forms to do useful things.
One of the useful things that we want people to be able to do with L4 is to build expert systems.
