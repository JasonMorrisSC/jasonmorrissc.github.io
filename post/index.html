Avoiding the Clause Order Hassle in s(CASP)

<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
The Clause Order Hassle Learning to use s(CASP) to encode legislation over the course of the last year or so has been at times frustrating. The reason for that is that I would often find myself with code that did not work as expected, and I could not understand why. Then, I would make changes, usually by changing the order of the lines of code, or by changing the number of predicates I was using, and the code would start to work.

I&rsquo;ve been playing around with an s(CASP) library for doing date math over the last little while, and finally found some time today to test it with s(CASP)&rsquo;s ability to do constraints over reals. I was interested to see if there was a way that we could convert the dates into timestamps and then have s(CASP) treat them as a constraint.
The Problem Here&rsquo;s my imaginary scenario. I am allowed to do something on any day that is in both the first and last 200 days of 2021.

Here we go again! In what risks becoming an annual tradition, around here, I&rsquo;ve decided to move the Rules as Code Diary away from Medium into a self-hosted blog built with hugo.
This is mainly motivated by the fact that a lot of what I&rsquo;m writing these days is actually code, and Medium is pretty limited in terms of what it can do to display code typed into the editor. Hugo, on the other hand, will show you more or less whatever I can type into a markdown document, with syntax highlighting.

It’s traditional at the end of the year to look back and see where you started, and how far you have come. I’m going to extend the look back to 2020, because I started Computational Law Diary half way through 2020.
A Little Personal Background I started my full-time career in computational law about the same time that I started the Computational Law Diary in July of 2020. I spent one year with the Singapore Management University Centre for Computational Law, as the Principal Research Engineer in Symbolic Artificial Intelligence.

Following up on the plan I wrote about a few days ago… By exposing all of the intermediate conclusions, and by adding separate variables that represent whether the primary variables are “known,” I’ve managed to create an encoding in OpenFisca that is capable of doing some cool stuff over the Web API.
You can see the source code in this GitHub repository, and the demos/explanations.py file demonstrates the use of the OpenFisca Web API with my rules as code encoding in Python.

At Service Canada we are working on a new tool to help Canadians to plan for retirement. And we are experimenting with implementing that system using a Rules as Code approach. Specifically, we are looking at implementing the rules in OpenFisca.
OpenFisca is a leading Rules as Code solution, but it is primarily aimed at microsimulation. Microsimulation is where you create a data model that represents small elements of a population, like people and households, and then encode the effects of different tax and benefit regimes.

Last December, Denis Merigoux and Liane Huttner presented a paper at the Algorithmic Law Symposium hosted at HEC Paris, on “Catala: Moving Towards the Future of Legal Expert Systems”. I’ve been meaning to take a look for some time, and finally managed it today.
[Edit: Denis Merigoux notes in the replies that the version of the paper I viewed was a pre-print before the authors had received the reviewer’s comments, which were only recently received, and some of which are echoed here.

Just had a great conversation with a colleague that helped me understand a challenges involved in implementing Rules as Code that hadn’t occured to me before.
The objective in Rules as Code is to write an encoding of the legislation that is as re-usable as possible. That means avoiding the temptation to put things into the encoding of the rules that only make sense to include in the context of a particular application.

I blogged recently about the opportunity to use s(CASP) inside SWISH, the web-based development environment for SWI-Prolog.
Today it is another web-based development environment for Rules as Code, OpenFisca inside Google Colab.
What is OpenFisca? OpenFisca is probably the world’s most popular open source tool for Rules as Code. It is used extensively in France, and is spreading around the world.
What is Google Colab(oratory)? Google Colab is a web-based implementation of Jupyter notebooks-a “literate programming” tool for the Python programming language-and Google’s cloud services.

Rules as Code is a movement in public administration that suggests that the digitization of legislation, regulation, and other rules should happen as early in their life cycle as possible, so as to improve policy design, improve legislative drafting, and massively simplify service automation and building software systems compliant with those rules.
It is an international movement, and it is an interdisciplinary movement. It impacts on people inside government, legislatures, regulatory bodies, regulated entities, academia, as well as technologists, lawyers, and more.

In yesterday’s post, I talked a little about how it would be nice if there was a way to use legislative scope to refer to sections of law, particularly to implement, in a structurally-isomorphic way, defeasibility statements like “subject to this act and the regulations.”
Today I’m going to share a small experiment I did in Flora-2 to see if I can demonstrate a working approach. I’d be interested in your thoughts.

You can “attend” it virtually by going to the Associação Lawgorithm youtube channel and following along with the live presentations today, tomorrow, and Thursday.
On the Monday and Friday of the conference there are typically a number of parallel workshops. Yesterday I followed along with the Explainable and Responsible AI in Law workshop, which was very interesting.

The idea is that you should be able to write legal rules, like laws or contracts, in L4, and other applications should be able to translate that encoding into other forms to do useful things.
One of the useful things that we want people to be able to do with L4 is to build expert systems.

I was working on an s(CASP) encoding last week, and learned something that gave me a better intuition for how to encode things well.
I needed to encode what counted as a business, and there were two things. I needed to encode what counted as a business entity, and there were 7 things, each of which required a business, which meant there were 14 possibilities total. Then I needed to encode what counted as an executive appointment, and there were three.

I’ve been spending a lot of time recently thinking about the problem of choosing how to model things when doing automated legal reasoning.
What is a Model? Just so we’re on the same page, when I talk about a model, there is a real thing, of some sort, and there is a representation of that thing in a language which is useful for some reason. The representation is the model, and the language is the modelling language.

<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Yesterday I posted about what justified stable model query-driven constraint answer set programming is. Now let me tell you a little bit about why I think all of that matters.
Defeasibility The higher-order logic features of s(CASP) make it very easy to implement forms of defeasibility the way it is implemented in legal writing, which is that the relationship is noted only in the default, or in the exception, but not in both.

I spent some time today trying to understand where s(CASP) fits into the world of programming languages more generally, and here’s what I think is going on.
Remember, I’m not an expert. This is my amateur understanding after playing with it for a few days.
What is the “Usual” type of programming language? The usual paradigm for programming languages is called imperative programming, in which you basically tell the computer what to do, and in what order.

OK, I think I’m going to call it. Flora-2 is no longer my favourite tool for doing Rules as Code. My new favourite is s(CASP).
I’m working on a paper for the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law at work, and I’m doing an experiment, the results of which are blowing me away.
I took a piece of legislation recommended by a potential industry partner, and encoded it in s(CASP).

How Argumentation Theory Can Be Used in Automating Reasoning about Conflicts of Law

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Flora-2 is a logic programming language that implements defeasible reasoning using a method called “defaults and argumentation theories.”
Here’s how it works.
Choose An Argumentation Theory The first thing you have to do is choose the argumentation theory that you want, but Flora-2 has a very intuitive default.
:- use_argumentation_theory. Tag Your Rules Flora-2 gives you the option of specifying that some rules override others either by identifying the rules, or by identifying the conclusions.

Are Smart Contracts Legal?

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I was pointed by a colleague to a paper on SSRN by two law professors proposing a method for making smart contracts “legal.”
What they mean, I take it, is that they want to make sure that smart contracts are enforceable in court the way “normal” contracts are. And the method they propose is a combination of natural language and code.
This is similar to the way clause.io uses blocks of natural language text combined with parallel blocks of code to allow you to generate smart contracts.

I took the opportunity over the last couple of days to spend some time working on long-planned upgrades to Blawx. It has been partly successful, and partly an exercise in frustration.
The frustration comes from the fact that I’m working with limited processing power here in my hotel room in Singapore, having only brought a Surface Go tablet with me for writing code. To get any further, I think I’m going to have to bite the bullet and pay for a development server.

January 14, 2021 was “World Logic Day”, and in celebration of it the Department of Computing Science at the University of Texas Dallas invited Robert Kowalski to give a speech on Logical English.
If you don’t know who Dr. Robert Kowalski is, he more or less invented logic programming in the 1970s. In the logic programming community, he is a “big deal.” He is also the first person I’m aware of to have used logic programming languages as a knowledge representation tool for legislation.
