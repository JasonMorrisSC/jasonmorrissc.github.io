Are Smart Contracts Legal?

</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I was pointed by a colleague to a paper on SSRN by two law professors proposing a method for making smart contracts “legal.”
What they mean, I take it, is that they want to make sure that smart contracts are enforceable in court the way “normal” contracts are. And the method they propose is a combination of natural language and code.
This is similar to the way clause.io uses blocks of natural language text combined with parallel blocks of code to allow you to generate smart contracts.

I took the opportunity over the last couple of days to spend some time working on long-planned upgrades to Blawx. It has been partly successful, and partly an exercise in frustration.
The frustration comes from the fact that I’m working with limited processing power here in my hotel room in Singapore, having only brought a Surface Go tablet with me for writing code. To get any further, I think I’m going to have to bite the bullet and pay for a development server.

January 14, 2021 was “World Logic Day”, and in celebration of it the Department of Computing Science at the University of Texas Dallas invited Robert Kowalski to give a speech on Logical English.
If you don’t know who Dr. Robert Kowalski is, he more or less invented logic programming in the 1970s. In the logic programming community, he is a “big deal.” He is also the first person I’m aware of to have used logic programming languages as a knowledge representation tool for legislation.

Alright, fellow legal nerds, let’s get deep in the weeds, here.
What is Event Calculus? A “calculus” is a way of reasoning about something. Event Calculus is a way of reasoning about events, and their consequences. I use consequences here to mean “what happens after those events have occured, and because those events have occurred.” So it is a calculus of causes, and a calculus of time.
What is Discrete Event Calculus?

So yesterday, I learned about something called s(CASP) that I needed to try.
Today I tried it. And it’s awesome. Here’s how it went.
Background I actually came across s(CASP) by accident while looking for something else. The name, I take it, means stable model constraint answer set programming. Which is the sort of name only a computer scientist could love. It was created by a team at the Joaquin Arias, Zhuo Chen, Manuel Carro, and Gopal Gupta at the IMDEA Software Institute at Universidad Politecnica de Madrid.

I’m working on some materials to help bring our junior researchers up to speed on Flora-2, and I noticed something interesting when trying to explain how Flora-2 does negation differently than other logic programming languages.
Three Nots In Flora-2 there are three different ways of saying “not”, and they all mean different things.
Classical Negation Classical negation comes from formal logic, and is expressed using the operator \neg. If you say \neg raining, what you are saying is that the truth-value of the statement raining is known to be false.

I’ve been working on Allen Interval Algebra, but in order to use Allen Interval Algebra you need to model your problem as a set of intervals. That is to say, you need to model the things that happen as happening over a period of time, as opposed to at a specific time.

If you read my last blog post about generating explanations for Flora-2 statements, you may recall that the explanation was full of a lot of symbols that were difficult to read. That problem has been greatly improved, so the explanation for “is Pugsley a sibling of Wednesday” looks like this:
Goal: Wednesday has a sibling, Pugsley is satisfied. We know this because there is a rule: two people are siblings if all of the parents of the first person are also parents of the second person Subgoal: (Wednesday is a Person and (Pugsley is a Person and (it is not true that ((an object A has a child, Wednesday and an object A is a Person) and (it is not true that an object A has a child, Pugsley))))) is not satisfied.

My working repo is here, if you’re interested in looking at the code.
So far, what we’ve got is explanations generated in a tree structure, using rule descriptions provided by the user, for variable-free queries that were answered using rules, conjunction (and), disjunction (or), negation (not), and user-specified facts.

Blawx is my web-based tool for Rules as Code. It is a graphical development environment that allows you to easily learn to encode legal knowledge, describe fact scenarios, and ask questions and get answers.
One of the features that is missing from Blawx is explanations for those answers. Explanations are a very important part of Rules as Code for two reasons. First, they provide the user with context and reasons for the results that your tool provides, which goes to the accountability and transparency of your tool, and increases its trustworthiness.

Today has been a very interesting day in Alberta. News broke that the rules for dealing with Covid-19 had changed last Saturday, just before the start of school this week. The new order reads, in part, as follows:
“… an operator of a school does not need to ensure that students, staff members, and visitors are able to maintain a minimum of 2 metres distance from every other person when a student, staff member or visitor is seated at a desk or table.

Search Space Episode 3 This past weekend I was listening to an episode of the Search Space, a wonderful podcast for just my particular breed of nerd, and Professor Chris Martens was talking about their language Ceptre, which is used for programming interactive worlds.
I’m now excited to learn more about linear logic and the “lolly” connective A -o B which in Ceptre can be used to say “if A is true, then there can be a transition in state where A is no longer true and B becomes true.

Last week a paper I wrote for the MIT Computational Law Report about using Blawx for Rules as Code was published. Please, please check it out and let me know what you think. Your feedback would be extremely valuable.
I had been hoping that the piece would start a conversation, but little did I know there was another paper published in the same release that was also talking about Blawx. The conversation had started already!

I’ve been preparing a presentation for the Canadian Institute for the Administration of Justice’s Legislative Drafting Conference on Rules as Code. In the process of trying to figure out how to introduce the topic of Rules as Code to legislative drafters, I’ve been thinking about the different meanings the term “Rules as Code” has been given.
Some people use “Rules as Code” to refer to the larger public service delivery methodology, which includes a method of legislative drafting, where you write the legislation in natural languages and computer languages at the same time.

I’m re-reading a 2011 dissertation by Tom Hvitved entitled “Contract Formalization and Modular Implementation of Domain-Specific Languages”.
Hvitved proposes a set of requirements for contract formalisms. Basically, it’s a list of capabilities a “way of describing a contract to a computer” should enable. Among his proposed requirements is a record of who is to blame if something goes wrong. As he writes:
In the case where a contract is breached, the monitor should not only report a breach of contract, but also who among the contract participants is responsible.

This week at work I got a wonderful lesson on Monads, which are a technique in functional programming. But what it taught me, more than what Monads are and why I should care, is how bad most people are at explaining computing science concepts. And how they could take a lesson from infomercials.
Monad Nomad I’ve watched multiple videos online, and read multiple chapters of tutorials trying to explain them, and come away baffled each time.

GPT-3 is a newly announced AI model produced by OpenAI, that is showing some remarkable capabilities. I’m going to give you a quick background into what it is, what it can do, and what that might mean for Rules as Code.
What is GPT-3? GPT-3, simplified, is a piece of software that can predict what the next word will be in a string of text. It can do that over and over, to the point where it can effectively write text that is almost indistinguishable from human writing.

[Edit: A previous version of this post incorrectly identified Brainbox.Institute as the people doing the research project described below. In fact, only two of the three researchers are associated with Brainbox. Apologies.]
Tom Barraclough, in a recent Medium post, put forward a test case that a team of independent researchers funded by the New Zealand Law Foundation had been working on and asked for feedback. This post is my attempt to contribute to that conversation.

So in the last post we got to the point where our model of the law understands what it needs to understand in order to be able to generate “Year of Employment” objects. In this post, we’re going to finish our rules, we’re going to generate an interview, and use it to debug problems in the law.
Fudging It (a little) I spent some time trying to get OPM to play nice, but ran into a number of brick walls.

This is the fifth in a series of posts following along with the Government of Canada’s Rules as Code project. Check out the earlier posts for context.
The Next Part of the Problem Let’s start with a reprint of the section we’re encoding, section 183’s definition of “year of employment.”
