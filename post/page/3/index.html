Legislative drafting in parliamentary democracies works differently than it does in the United States, for example.

In this post, I will show you how you can use Ergo Lite to automatically generate all possible schedules.
In some of the questions we are going to encode, the question will be whether something is always true or never true about a schedule that adheres to the rules.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="mb3 pa4 mid-gray overflow-hidden"><div class=f6>April 25, 2019</div><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/post/roundtablelaw/a-computer-takes-the-lsat-question-6-884c47d55b2b/ class="link black dim">A Computer Takes the LSAT: Question 6</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the 4th in a series of posts about encoding LSAT questions in the Ergo Lite programming language.

In this post, we will encode the first of 5 questions using the code we generated earlier.
Question 6 reads as follows:
6. Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate description of the order in which the films are shown at the festival?</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="mb3 pa4 mid-gray overflow-hidden"><div class=f6>April 25, 2019</div><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/post/roundtablelaw/a-computer-takes-the-lsat-question-7-aa98d14d3217/ class="link black dim">A Computer Takes the LSAT: Question 7</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the 5th in a series of posts describing how to encode LSAT Puzzles in the Ergo Lite programming language.

In this post, we will encode Question 7, which reads:
7. Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
(A) Harvest is the last film shown on each day of the festival.
(B) Limelight is shown on each day of the festival.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="mb3 pa4 mid-gray overflow-hidden"><div class=f6>April 25, 2019</div><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/post/roundtablelaw/a-computer-takes-the-lsat-question-8-bf39194443da/ class="link black dim">A Computer Takes the LSAT: Question 8</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the 6th in a series of posts about encoding LSAT Puzzles in the Ergo Lite programming language.

In this post, we will encode Question 8. It reads:
8.

In this post, we will encode Question 9, which reads:
9. If Greed is shown exactly three times, Harvest is shown exactly twice, and Limelight is shown exactly once, then which one of the following must be true?
(A) All three films are shown on Thursday.</div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="mb3 pa4 mid-gray overflow-hidden"><div class=f6>April 25, 2019</div><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/post/roundtablelaw/a-computer-takes-the-lsat-question-10-2172137fdc57/ class="link black dim">A Computer Takes the LSAT: Question 10</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the 8th in a series of posts about encoding LSAT Puzzles in the Ergo Lite programming language.

In this post, we will encode the last question, question 10. It reads:

In this post, we will encode the “preamble” to the section of questions. These are the basic rules that apply to all of the following questions. By analogy to automating legal services, these rules represent statute law or regulations.</div></div></div></aside><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/post/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/post/page/2/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/post/ aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/post/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/post/page/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/post/page/4/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/post/page/4/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://JasonMorrisSC.github.io>&copy; Jason Morris 2022</a><div><div class=ananke-socials><a href=https://twitter.com/RoundTableLaw target=_blank class="twitter ananke-social-link link-transition stackoverflow link dib z-999 pt3 pt0-l mr1" title="Twitter link" rel=noopener aria-label="follow on Twitter——Opens in a new window"><span class=icon><svg style="enable-background:new 0 0 67 67" viewBox="0 0 67 67" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M37.167 22.283c-2.619.953-4.274 3.411-4.086 6.101l.063 1.038-1.048-.127c-3.813-.487-7.145-2.139-9.974-4.915l-1.383-1.377-.356 1.017c-.754 2.267-.272 4.661 1.299 6.271.838.89.649 1.017-.796.487-.503-.169-.943-.296-.985-.233-.146.149.356 2.076.754 2.839.545 1.06 1.655 2.097 2.871 2.712l1.027.487-1.215.021c-1.173.0-1.215.021-1.089.467.419 1.377 2.074 2.839 3.918 3.475l1.299.444-1.131.678c-1.676.976-3.646 1.526-5.616 1.568C19.775 43.256 19 43.341 19 43.405c0 .211 2.557 1.397 4.044 1.864 4.463 1.377 9.765.783 13.746-1.568 2.829-1.673 5.657-5 6.978-8.221.713-1.716 1.425-4.851 1.425-6.354.0-.975.063-1.102 1.236-2.267.692-.678 1.341-1.419 1.467-1.631.21-.403.188-.403-.88-.043-1.781.636-2.033.551-1.152-.402.649-.678 1.425-1.907 1.425-2.267.0-.063-.314.042-.671.233-.377.212-1.215.53-1.844.72l-1.131.361-1.027-.7c-.566-.381-1.361-.805-1.781-.932C39.766 21.902 38.131 21.944 37.167 22.283zM33 64C16.432 64 3 50.569 3 34S16.432 4 33 4s30 13.431 30 30S49.568 64 33 64z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:{{ .fill }}"/></svg></span><span class=new-window><svg height="8" style="enable-background:new 0 0 1000 1000" viewBox="0 0 1e3 1e3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><path d="M598 128h298v298h-86V274L392 692l-60-60 418-418H598v-86zM810 810V512h86v298c0 46-40 86-86 86H214c-48 0-86-40-86-86V214c0-46 38-86 86-86h298v86H214v596h596z" style="fill-rule:evenodd;clip-rule:evenodd;fill:"/></svg></span></a></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
