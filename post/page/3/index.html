This week at work I got a wonderful lesson on Monads, which are a technique in functional programming. But what it taught me, more than what Monads are and why I should care, is how bad most people are at explaining computing science concepts. And how they could take a lesson from infomercials.
Monad Nomad I’ve watched multiple videos online, and read multiple chapters of tutorials trying to explain them, and come away baffled each time.

GPT-3 is a newly announced AI model produced by OpenAI, that is showing some remarkable capabilities. I’m going to give you a quick background into what it is, what it can do, and what that might mean for Rules as Code.
What is GPT-3? GPT-3, simplified, is a piece of software that can predict what the next word will be in a string of text. It can do that over and over, to the point where it can effectively write text that is almost indistinguishable from human writing.

So in the last post we got to the point where our model of the law understands what it needs to understand in order to be able to generate “Year of Employment” objects. In this post, we’re going to finish our rules, we’re going to generate an interview, and use it to debug problems in the law.

Scott McNaughton’s latest blog post about the Government of Canada’s Rules as Code project indicates that they have decided to change the scope of the project a little bit.
The first thing is that they have decided they are worried primarily about being able to answer questions about how much vacation pay is due, and not questions about entitlement to vacation periods.
The second thing he mentions is that they want to be able to take into account what is called “protected leave.

This is an idea that has come up in a few conversations over the last few weeks.
Legislative drafting in parliamentary democracies works differently than it does in the United States, for example. In a parliamentary democracy, the government, in the “executive branch” sense, remains the government because they have the “confidence” of the legislature, which is the legislative branch. “Confidence,” simplified, means that when the government puts forward something it wants to enact as a law, the legislature adopts it.

Blawx is a tool for allowing people to easily encode written legal rules, and power other applications over the web with those encodings.
We have now built our first proof-of-concept web integration, with docassemble, demonstrating how rules you build in Blawx can be used to give legal reasoning capabilities to any other tool on the web.
The Rules: Rock Paper Scissors The first step is to encode the rules that you need.

Here’s how we generally build tools that automate legal reasoning now:
So we have some rules, and we have a question we would like to answer. A programmer comes up with a procedure for answering that question given the rules, and encodes that procedure in an algorithm. The algorithm and the data (collected from the user somehow) are given to the computer, and the computer follows the steps in the algorithm and spits out an answer.

I’ve been having conversations with people on twitter recently about my aspirational view that encoding laws will not always require programmers to be involved.
I am both a lawyer and a programmer, so it’s easy for me to be wrong about that sort of thing. So I’d like to share an example of why I think it’s possible, and you can decide for yourself.
The basic idea of Rules as Code is we take rules, we encode them, and that allows us and others to build more and better helpful applications.

This is the 6th in a series of posts about encoding LSAT Puzzles in the Ergo Lite programming language. To start from the beginning, go to the introductory post.
In this post, we will encode Question 8. It reads:
8. If Limelight is never shown again during the festival once Greed is shown, then which one of the following is the maximum number of film showings that could occur during the festival?

In this post, we will encode the “preamble” to the section of questions. These are the basic rules that apply to all of the following questions. By analogy to automating legal services, these rules represent statute law or regulations.

In this series of posts I’m going to show you what it looks like when you use a programming language called Ergo Lite to get a computer to answer puzzle questions from an LSAT exam.
The LSAT is the standardized admissions exam that most lawyers in North America will have suffered through, so I’m hoping it is a sort of shared experience that gives us lawyers a shared starting point.

Demo: Logic Coding Inside Docassemble
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
Logic coding is awesome for automating legal services, and more lawyers should be doing it.-Me.
I’m on a mission to prove that. I’ve got a list of obstacles in front of me that look distinctly like opportunities.
Take for example, the opportunity “programming is hard.” I am working on www.Blawx.com, which aims to make learning it way easier. Check out this short demo video for more details.
Another opportunity is that people don’t know how to get value out of logic programming.

Utterly Unpersuasive: Formal Methods and Law
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
This is a story in which Hillel Wayne attempts to answer the question why don’t more programmers use formal methods?
Formal methods are techniques that allow you to say with confidence that your software is right, instead of just trying it and waiting for a bug to show you where the software was wrong.
They can be applied to laws and contracts, too, but aren’t. But should be. That’s why I read the article, to see if there is something that I could learn about how to make formal methods more popular in law.

Blawx Prototype Redux
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I posted here earlier about a prototype tool that I’m working on to make it easier for lawyers to use declarative programming tools for automating legal reasoning. It’s called “Blawx.”
I spent some more time working on it over the weekend, and made some progress, as you can see in the (now narrated) video linked below.
I have implemented code generation based on the block diagram, implemented the reasoner online with a CGI wrapper so that it can be accessed by the Blawx page, updated the interface to have an answer window at the bottom, and have changed the way that answers are received so that it is possible to get back the answers to questions that have more than one solution.

I was invited to write a piece as a guest blogger for Slaw.ca, one of the premier legal blogs in Canada, on blockchain nonsense.
If you wonder why so many people 🙄 at the mention of blockchain, it might be useful to you.
Check it out.

Blawx: Seeking Feedback on a Prototype Tool for Encoding Law
</a>
</h1>
<div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
I study declarative programming tools for automating legal reasoning in my Computational Law LLM at the University of Alberta. What I have learned is that they are both very powerful, and highly inaccessible for normal legal service providers.
I have had an idea in my head for how to solve that problem for a long time now. I’ve told people about it, but it’s the sort of thing that needs to be shown to be understood.
