It is held bi-annually, and it is currently being “hosted” virtually in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
You can “attend” it virtually by going to the Associação Lawgorithm youtube channel and following along with the live presentations today, tomorrow, and Thursday.
On the Monday and Friday of the conference there are typically a number of parallel workshops. Yesterday I followed along with the Explainable and Responsible AI in Law workshop, which was very interesting.</description></item></channel></rss>
